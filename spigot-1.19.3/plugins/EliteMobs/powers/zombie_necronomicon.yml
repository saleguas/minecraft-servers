summoningChant: Nor is it to be thought...that man is either the oldest or the last
  of earth's masters, or that the common bulk of life and substance walks alone. The
  Old Ones were, the Old Ones are, and the Old Ones shall be. Not in the spaces we
  know, but between them, they walk serene and primal, undimensioned and to us unseen.
  Yog-Sothoth knows the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the key and
  guardian of the gate. Past, present, future, all are one in Yog-Sothoth. He knows
  where the Old Ones broke through of old, and where They shall break through again.
  He knows where They had trod earth's fields, and where They still tread them, and
  why no one can behold Them as They tread. By Their smell can men sometimes know
  Them near, but of Their semblance can no man know, saving only in the features of
  those They have begotten on mankind; and of those are there many sorts, differing
  in likeness from man's truest eidolon to that shape without sight or substance which
  is Them. They walk unseen and foul in lonely places where the Words have been spoken
  and the Rites howled through at their Seasons. The wind gibbers with Their voices,
  and the earth mutters with Their consciousness. They bend the forest and crush the
  city, yet may not forest or city behold the hand that smites. Kadath in the cold
  waste hath known Them, and what man knows Kadath? The ice desert of the South and
  the sunken isles of Ocean hold stones whereon Their seal is engraver, but who hath
  seen the deep frozen city or the sealed tower long garlanded with seaweed and barnacles?
  Great Cthulhu is Their cousin, yet can he spy Them only dimly. IÃ¤! Shub-Niggurath!
  As a foulness shall ye know Them. Their hand is at your throats, yet ye see Them
  not; and Their habitation is even one with your guarded threshold. Yog-Sothoth is
  the key to the gate, whereby the spheres meet. Man rules now where They ruled once;
  They shall soon rule where man rules now. After summer is winter, after winter summer.
  They wait patient and potent, for here shall They reign again.
