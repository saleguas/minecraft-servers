This command just collects the blocks held in BlockStorage into a single file denoting the item ID and the amount held in storage.\r\n\r\nRecently many servers have had issues with BlockStorage and a simple fix (for some) has been to show them just how many of a certain block they have to allow them to triage and tackle the amount. This has been very positive for servers with ExoticGarden where they have had upwards of millions of several of plants which, when they purged them, released a not insignificant amount of RAM. \r\n\r\nUntil now I have just offered this command as a separate JAR to server owners having issues and worked through the resolution with them but I think it makes sense to have the command here, regardless of the few use-cases.\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\nAdd a new command that dumps contents into a file.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"642\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20646323/211083935-a495b0c0-1e59-4bce-af01-384d03f6c123.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"661\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20646323/211083985-afcb2a33-0fdf-45ff-98da-59ce68c23b11.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"537\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20646323/211081434-9668fd86-886a-4e52-ae25-9244a7762180.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"300\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20646323/211084043-f06538f4-8f33-4930-b916-f4161d13d7af.png\">\r\n\r\n## Related Issues (if applicable)\r\n<!-- Please tag any Issues related to your Pull Request -->\r\n<!-- Syntax: \"Resolves #000\" -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Here is a little checklist you can follow. -->\r\n<!-- Click on these checkboxes after you created the pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Don't worry, these are not requirements.

The bug is that SF electricity generators are changing to vanilla items, but all items can change this way based on the code from the error I'm posting below. \r\n\r\nPlease fix this as soon as possible, this is a very serious bug as players may start to abuse it and ask us to replace a vanilla block with an op generator, but the block was never a generator.\r\n\r\n\n\n### üìë Reproduction

Description\r\nI have recently run into an issue where a world, when created quickly enough after deletion of a world with the same name, will not store data. I have tested this extensively and narrowed the issue down to [this](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/blob/master/src/main/java/io/github/thebusybiscuit/slimefun4/implementation/tasks/TickerTask.java#L102) ticker code and [this](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/blob/master/src/main/java/me/mrCookieSlime/Slimefun/api/BlockStorage.java#L116) check for the world's existence. Since the ticker code only runs every half second, it does not remove the world from the registry until up to a Slimefun tick later and therefore causes issues in the constructor.\r\n\r\nAn easy way to recreate this issue is to delete a world and immediately create a new one with the same name.\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\nThis PR changes the registry to use UUIDs instead of the world names themselves. This _does not_ affect the storage location in files and therefore these are not breaking changes.\r\n\r\nThis may not be the ideal way to do it; it may be better to remove the world from the registry [here](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/blob/master/src/main/java/io/github/thebusybiscuit/slimefun4/implementation/listeners/WorldListener.java#L28) instead.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues (if applicable)\r\nNo issue opened\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Here is a little checklist you can follow. -->\r\n<!-- Click on these checkboxes after you created the pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Don't worry, these are not requirements.

writing below this line -->\r\n\r\nChanged CraftingOperation to take into account the new ticks config. Normalize the value to the default one of one operation per 10 ticks. \r\n\r\nChanged NumberUtils. Added logic that calculates the time new changes will take to finish the operation.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues (if applicable)\r\n<!-- Please tag any Issues related to your Pull Request -->\r\n<!-- Syntax: \"Resolves #000\" -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\n\r\nNot sure if there is na issue open.\r\n\r\nHere is how to reproduce the issue:\r\n1. Adjust custom-ticker-delay to 20.\r\n2. Run a ticker ingame.\r\n3. The display timer will be wrong the execution slows down by 1/2 so the secounds and minutes are not synced to the actual values.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Here is a little checklist you can follow. -->\r\n<!-- Click on these checkboxes after you created the pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Don't worry, these are not requirements.

Description\r\nThis isn't directly for Slimefun. Many addons have blocks that display information about their current operational status within a GUI inventory. While this is a good way to do this from the player's perspective, this creates a BlockMenu that is kept in RAM indefinitely which has recently been the cause of some issues. While the block storage rewrite will likely be the best 'fix' for this, for now this is to allow addons to remove information-only GUIs for their machines.\r\n\r\nThe biggest 'offender' for this is InfinityExpansion which in my most recent example server had 70k~ of these inventories which are, effectively, wasting RAM - and a lot of it.\r\nIf accepted I will be using this in Infinity, Networks and Tinker and will recommend to any other addons with similar blocks.\r\n\r\nThis solution will allow addons to display the information they are trying to put forward through the MultiMeter\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\nAdd a new ItemAttribute that addons can implement to add additional messages to the MultiMeter.\r\n\r\nThis could easily be a new tool instead. While I think it fits well in the MultiMeter, I'm happy to make a new item for this purpose.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues (if applicable)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Here is a little checklist you can follow. -->\r\n<!-- Click on these checkboxes after you created the pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Don't worry, these are not requirements.

This only happens to Slimefun blocks, vanilla blocks will drop just fine. Also this seems to clear block storage data on that coordinate as well.\n\n### üìë Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Enable `call-explosive-event` on explosive pickaxe\r\n2. Try to break Slimefun blocks\r\n3. See it only drops the one you are hitting with it\n\n### üí° Expected Behavior\n\nIt should drop all the Slimefun blocks\n\n### üì∑ Screenshots / Videos\n\nhttps://youtu.be/OG7TwUCqqzg\n\n### üìú

‚ùó Checklist\n\n- [X] I am using the official english version of Slimefun and did not modify the jar.\n- [X] I am using an up to date \"DEV\" (not \"RC\") version of Slimefun.\n- [X] I am aware that issues related to Slimefun addons need to be reported on their bug trackers and not here.\n- [X] I searched for similar open issues and could not find an existing bug report on this.\n\n### üìç Description\n\nHi, I was recently creating an SMP server, and I tried installing ItemsAdder, Slimefun, and an ItemsAdder addon called IAxPresenceFootsteps, which adds compatibility for the mod Presence Footsteps to ItemsAdder.\r\nhttps://github.com/Andre601/IAxPresenceFootsteps\r\nHowever, when I tested the mod, I noticed that when Slimefun was installed, it caused IAxPresenceFootsteps to load before ItemsAdder instead of after, and since ItemsAdder is a dependency of IAxPresenceFootsteps, the plugin doesn't work.\n\n### üìë Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Download the latest versions of Slimefun, ItemsAdder, and IAxPresenceFootsteps to a server.\r\n2. Start the server\r\n3. Notice that IAxPresenceFootsteps loads before ItemsAdder instead of after like it should?\n\n### üí° Expected Behavior\n\nI expected IAxPresenceFootsteps to load after ItemsAdder like it normally does instead of before as it did here.\n\n### üì∑ Screenshots / Videos\n\n_No response_\n\n### üìú Server Log\n\nhttps://pastebin.com/mc7i7tZP\n\n### üìÇ `/error-reports/` folder\n\n_No

Description\r\n<!-- Please explain why you are making this pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\n\r\nSupercedes #3384 \r\n\r\nSlimefunItemStacks that share an ID are currently automatically stacked when running through cargo. Items that vary by lore or another meta aspect are being 'merged' with items that happen to match on ID but are, otherwise, distinct. See issue #3379. This likely only effects backpacks within core Slimefun but also effects any similar SlimefunItems using similar distinctions - DankPacks and Tinkers parts (I'm so self centred!) being an example.\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\nNew `ItemAttribute` called `DistinctiveItem` to act as an identifier for items that match this criterion.\r\nDistinctive item has a method that allows an implementation to say how two same-ID items can be distinguished.\r\nSlimefunBackpack has been amended to implement this interface.\r\n`SlimefunUtils#isItemSimilar` now checks if the stack's SlimefunItem is a DistinctiveItem and, if so, return the result of the `canStack` method.\r\n\r\nDiscussion with Walshy shows this is making an extra call to get the ID from the Meta that was already made in the previous `getItemData` that may mean this PR needs more work.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues (if applicable)\r\n<!-- Please tag any Issues related to your Pull Request -->\r\n<!-- Syntax: \"Resolves #000\" -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\n\r\nResolves #3379\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Here is a little checklist you can follow. -->\r\n<!-- Click on these checkboxes after you created the pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Don't worry, these are not requirements.

The main problem I need to fix, is actually fact that players are able to enchant mmoitems witch blocked use in enchanting tables or anvils in sf autoenchanters. in. My items are blocked against enchanting but in sf you can simply bypass it. I know there's a way to add blocked lore. But what about old items without that lore? A lot of of my players using items without this lore.\r\n\r\nSo what I need to add ?\r\nEasily check stats from mmoitem and if it has blocked using in crafting, enchanting.., it won't be possible to upgrade this item. This will be probably better than using lores, because it will apply to all items no matter how old those items are.\r\n\r\nLet me know, if it is possible, thanks and have a good day!\r\n\r\n### üìë Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\nCreate an mmoitem and block it's interaction in enchanting tables/anvils.\r\nAdd this item to slimefun autoenchanter.\r\nYou can add this item there.\r\n\r\n### üí° Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nMMOItems with blocked features like using them in enchanting tables, they should not be usable in sf as well.\r\n\r\n### üì∑ Screenshots /

certain.\r\n\r\nThis simply serves as a rough guide for you to see what changes you can be excited about.\r\nMany of those changes will likely be of technical nature though, so they may not be as exciting or intesting at first.\r\n\r\nAlso, we aren't actively looking for pull requests towards these goals unless explicitly requested.\r\nIf you wish to make a pull request, choose any open issue or approved suggestion and you are more than welcome :heart:\r\nThese changes however are mainly targeted towards the core team.\r\n\r\n## ‚≠ê Upcoming changes\r\nSome of these milestones will have a

:---: | :------- |\r\n| üîß | Technical change / API |\r\n| üéà | New Features |\r\n| üí° | Performance improvements |\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Older changes</summary>\r\n\r\n### üîß ~~(September 3rd - 6th 2021) API relocation~~ - **DONE**\r\nThe first upcoming change is a major relocation of some of our classes to unify some packages, get rid of old classpaths and to follow the general conventions. You can read more about this here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3139\r\n\r\n### üîß ~~(Q3 2022) Updating to Java 16~~\r\nSlimefun will update to Java 16.\r\nYou can see the progress here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3602\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### üéà(Q3 2022) New sound-system\r\nSoon we will allow server owners to fully configure any sound in this plugin.\r\nThis will also work with custom sounds from resource packs. Additionally you can change the pitch and volume of any sound or even mute it.\r\nYou can see the progress here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/2844\r\n\r\n### üîß (2023) Inventory system rewrite\r\nNext up is a rewrite for our inventory-system. The API is very rusty and aged. We don't have an ETA yet, perhaps closely after or along with the aforementioned API relocation.\r\nThe new system will be much more flexible and easier to use for developers.\r\n\r\n### üéà (2023) Changes to the radiation system\r\nThanks to @Semisol you will soon be able to enjoy a new radiation system which works by calculating a so-called \"exposure level\" to a radioactive substance. You won't experience radiation symptoms until a certain exposure level has been reached.\r\nThis will also make the different radiation levels much more distinct from each other and the features comes with a few good-looking UI changes too! You can track the progress of that here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3189\r\n\r\n### üéà (2023) SQL database support and Research system rewrite\r\nThe Research system will be rewritten api-wise.\r\nWe will also drop numeric ids for researches and solely rely on namespaced keys.\r\nIn addition to this, we will add support for SQL databases to sync researches across multiple servers.\r\nAlternatively, a local file-based database can be used.\r\n\r\n### üîß (2023) Recipe system rewrite\r\nOur recipe system is in deep need of a rewrite, it needs to be much less item-comparison based and we should allow alternate ingredients through the use of material tags or slimefun item classes and such.\r\nI will be doing this rewrite myself and some infrastructure has been set up already but nothing to show you yet, it is still a while until we get there.\r\n\r\n### üéà (2023) Programmable androids rewrite\r\nProgrammable androids are great.\r\nBut they can be better! We will be stripping the data of an android from its block and give it a unique identity instead.\r\nThe UI will be completely redone and it will have much better performance. Oh, and you will be able to give other players access to your android and configure their permissions.\r\n\r\n### üîß (TBD) Ticker rewrite\r\nThanks to @LinoxGH and @md5sha256 our ticker system will be rewritten to be much more reliable.\r\nThis will also include some API changes that are yet to be added, you can track the progress here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/2996\r\n\r\n### üîß (TBD) BlockStorage system rewrite\r\nThe \"block-storage\" system will be rewritten, the API will change drastically and we will open it up for much more efficient storage methods, this will do a lot in regards to stability and performance in the long-run.\r\nYou can track the progress here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/2792\r\n\r\n### üîß (TBD) Changes to the config system and perhaps a reload command\r\nWe haven't fully decided on this one yet but you can follow the progress here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/2822\r\n\r\n### üí° (TBD) Cargo networks rewrite\r\nWhere do we even start here... It needs a rewrite, nuff said.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üéâ Feedback\r\nWe are always looking for feedback!\r\nIf you have something to suggest, check out our discord server @ https://discord.gg/slimefun and visit `#suggestions`.\r\nWe are always eager to see what the community wants or doesn't want.\r\nIf you are a developer and have questions or concerns regarding some of the more technical changes, simply post your question in `#programming-help` and we will get back to you!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3170/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3170/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3147","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3147/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3147/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3147/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3147","id":936663462,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU5MzY2NjM0NjI=","number":3147,"title":"Items on Ancient Pedestal can be moved with falling block","user":{"login":"Ltfjx","id":69747100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NzQ3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69747100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ltfjx","html_url":"https://github.com/Ltfjx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ltfjx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ltfjx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ltfjx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ltfjx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ltfjx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ltfjx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ltfjx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ltfjx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ltfjx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":499484638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0OTk0ODQ2Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%90%9E%20Bug%20Report","name":"üêû Bug Report","color":"d73f1f","default":false,"description":"A bug that needs to be fixed."},{"id":2642156940,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjQyMTU2OTQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%A7%A8%20Confirmed%20Bug","name":"üß® Confirmed Bug","color":"B3EFFA","default":false,"description":"This bug has been confirmed by our team."}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2021-07-05T04:10:45Z","updated_at":"2021-11-30T18:21:47Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"### ‚ùó Checklist\n\n- [X] I am using the official english version of Slimefun and did not modify the jar.\n- [X] I am using an up to date \"DEV\" (not \"RC\") version of Slimefun.\n- [X] I am aware that issues related to Slimefun addons need to be reported on their bug trackers and not here.\n- [x] I searched for similar open issues and could not find an existing bug report on this.\n\n### üìç Description\n\nGravity blocks like snad can not be place upon the Ancient Pedestal.

I was wondering if there is a way to unload the various slimefun blocks, instead of just saving them, as happens now.\r\n\r\nOr a help where you simply tell me mainly the classes that I should touch/look at in order to understand how to fix the problem... for now I have tried to fix the networks, I actually managed to do it, at least that's what I hoped for... but the problem persists...\r\n\r\n\r\n(I solved the problem of networks by unloading them when the world is unloaded (onWorldUnload event), using the method provided)\n\n### üìë Reproduction Steps\n\nto reproduce this problem you need 1 plugin that allows you to Unloose and load worlds (like SlimeWorld or MultiverseCore)\r\n\r\n1) at startup place slimefun blocks in a new world (not the main one!), create 1 network (cargo or Energy) and the furnaces that generate electricity (i.e. the head)\r\n\r\n2) Unload the world with /mv unload worldName or /swm unload worldName (make sure there is nobody in this world when you do these commands!)\r\n\r\n3) Wait a few minutes and reload the world with /mv load worldName or /swm load worldName.\n\n### üí° Expected Behavior\n\ndepends on what you place, I found errors in the console (in the case of the furnaces that generate electricity, due to lack of network) or simply the various blocks stop working properly (since are duplicated, or unusable due to the existence of a duplicate router)\n\n### üì∑ Screenshots / Videos\n\n_No response_\n\n### üìú Server Log\n\n_No response_\n\n### üìÇ `/error-reports/` folder\n\n_No response_\n\n### üíª Server Software\n\nYatopia\n\n### üéÆ Minecraft Version\n\n1.16.x\n\n### ‚≠ê Slimefun version\n\nI use a recoding of the v4.9 \n\n### üß≠ Other plugins\n\nAdvancedSlimeWorldManager","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3090/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3090/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3076","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3076/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3076/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3076/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3076","id":899857016,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU4OTk4NTcwMTY=","number":3076,"title":"Slimefun and PyroMining incompatibility ","user":{"login":"ItsSynchro","id":16171807,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTcxODA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16171807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro","html_url":"https://github.com/ItsSynchro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":499484638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0OTk0ODQ2Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%90%9E%20Bug%20Report","name":"üêû Bug Report","color":"d73f1f","default":false,"description":"A bug that needs to be fixed."},{"id":2629433731,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjI5NDMzNzMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%8E%AF%20Needs%20testing","name":"üéØ Needs testing","color":"41CF62","default":false,"description":"This Issue needs to be tested by our team to see if it can be reproduced."}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2021-05-24T17:24:36Z","updated_at":"2021-11-30T18:21:46Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"<!-- FILL IN THE FORM BELOW -->\r\n\r\n## :round_pushpin: Description (REQUIRED)\r\n<!-- A clear and detailed description of what went wrong. -->\r\n<!-- The more information you can provide, the easier we can handle this problem. -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\n\r\nUpon using PyroMining and Slimefun, individuals are able to obtain PyroMining items if they break ores with a pickaxe that they don't have researched.

Description\r\n<!-- Please explain what you changed/added and why you did it in detail. -->\r\nThis pull request adds the `SoundService` and the `SoundEffect` enum which allow us to easily play sounds\r\nbut also allow server owners to easily configure and customize sounds.\r\nNote here that I opted for the minecraft-ids of sounds rather than the bukkit constants because this will allow\r\nserver owners to use completely custom sounds in combination with resource packs.\r\nIf a sound does not exist, the player will simply not hear anything, no error will be thrown.\r\n\r\nWhen values are misconfigured, a helpful warning will appear in the console.\r\nThis will also protect us against Mojang sound changes in the future, as we don't have to worry about the support of changed enum constants or such.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of the new config file:\r\n```yaml\r\nPORTABLE_CRAFTER_OPEN_SOUND:\r\n  sound: entity.wolf.howl\r\n  volume: 1.0\r\n  pitch: 0.123456789\r\nSPLINT_CONSUME_SOUND:\r\n  sound: entity.skeleton.hurt\r\n  volume: 1.0\r\n  pitch: 1.0\r\nTRASH_CAN_OPEN_SOUND:\r\n  sound: i.dont.exist.btw.spinach.sucks.and.pineapple.on.pizza.rules\r\n  volume: 1.0\r\n  pitch: 1.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### ToDo (Why this is still a draft)\r\n* [x] MockBukkit does not support String-sounds atm, so Unit Tests will fail, I will need to update MockBukkit for that first\r\n* [ ] I would like to add Unit Tests for this sound service too\r\n* [ ] Not all sounds have been converted yet\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Here is a little checklist you should follow. -->\r\n<!-- You can click those check boxes after you posted your issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have fully tested the proposed changes and promise that they will not break everything into chaos.\r\n- [x] I have also tested the proposed changes in combination with various popular addons and can confirm my changes do not break them.\r\n- [x] I followed the existing code standards and didn't mess up the formatting.\r\n- [x] I did my best to add documentation to any public classes or methods I added.\r\n- [x] I have added `Nonnull` and `Nullable` annotations to my methods to indicate their behaviour for null values\r\n- [ ] I added sufficient Unit Tests to cover my code.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/2844/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/2844/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/2835","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/2835/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/2835/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/2835/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/2835","id":814068423,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU4MTQwNjg0MjM=","number":2835,"title":"Default
